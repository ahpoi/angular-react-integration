# AngularReactIntegrationSpike

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2.

Learning after the spike: 

- You need to use at least angular cli version 6 or 7. Those have `tsx` options enabled in the webpack. 
- You lose CSS encapsultions eg in angular components (View.None), so all your styling is global. Therefore you need to use libraries such as `typestyle` or `emotion-js`to provide component view encapsulation for your styling. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
